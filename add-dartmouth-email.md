# Add Dartmouth Email

Now that you have a GitHub account, it is time to add your Dartmouth email to it in two forms:
- name@dartmouth.edu (might already be there if you created the account for work only)
- netid@dartmouth.edu (needed for single-sign to work)

## Steps

- Browse to https://github.com/settings/emails and log in if required
- Under the "Add email address" section, add both:
  - name@dartmouth.edu
  - netid@dartmouth.edu
- Go to your mailbox and click the link to complete verification for both addresses

That's it, you now have a fully setup GitHub account and you're ready to be added as a member of one or more Dartmouth GitHub organizations.

## Next steps

At this time, access to Dartmouth's GitHub organizations is limited to invite only. In the future, we may open to the broader community. If you were sent these instructions from from a Dartmouth staff member you should also expect them to invite you to the appropriate organizations or give you further instruction.

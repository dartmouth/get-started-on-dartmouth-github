<h1>Get Started on Dartmouth GitHub</h1>

<p>Looking to get started on Dartmouth College's Enterprise GitHub environment? You've come to the right place.</p>

<p>There are three things you need
<ol>
<li>A personal github.com account</li>
<li>Your college email address (form: netid@dartmouth.edu) added to it</li>
<li>An invite to one or more of the Dartmouth's GitHub organizations within our Enterprise tenant.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Let's get started.
<ul>
<li><a href="./create-account">I need a GitHub account</a></li>
<li><a href="./add-dartmouth-email">I already have a GitHub account</a></li>
</ul>

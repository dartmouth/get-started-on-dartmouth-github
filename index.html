<h1>Get Started on Dartmouth GitHub</h1>

<p>Looking to get started on Dartmouth College's Enterprise GitHub environment? You've come to the right place.</p>

<p>There are three things you need
<ol>
<li>A GitHub account</li>
<li>Your college email address (form: netid@dartmouth.edu) added to it</li>
<li>An invite to one or more of the Dartmouth's GitHub organizations within our Enterprise tenant.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Let's get started.
<ul>
<li><a href="./create-account">I need a GitHub account</a></li>
<li><a href="./add-dartmouth-email">I already have a GitHub account</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Level up your Git-fu</h1>

<p>If you're all set on getting started consider making these changes to improve your setup.</p>

<ul id="level-up">

  <li id="disable-watch"><a href="#disable-watch">Disable watching repositories automatically</a></li>
  <div id="disable-watch-steps">
    By default you are signed up to watch all repositories you have push access to. If you do not want to get emails for those repos then here's how you can disable that.
    <ul>
      <li>Log into GitHub</li>
      <li>Browse to <a href="https://github.com/settings/notifications" target="_blank">settings/notifications</a> (in the top right click your profile icon and then "Settings", then on the left click "Notifications")</li>
      <li>Towards the top, find the "Automatically watch repositories" section and toggle it to "Off"</li>
    </ul>
    If you're finding this after already getting lots of notifications and you wish to turn them off, follow these steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Log into GitHub</li>
      <li>Browse to <a href="https://github.com/watching" target="_blank">watching</a> (in the top right click your profile icon and then "Settings", then on the left click "Notifications"), next click "View watched repositories" under the Subscription section.</li>
      <li>At the top in red there is a "Unwatch all" button that has a filter or you can individually change "Watch" to "Participating and @mentions" (yes, that value is the same as unwatching a repo, "ignoring" a repo goes further and turns everything off).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <li id="default-branch"><a href="#default-branch">Set your default branch to main (instead of master)</a></li>
  <div id="default-branch-steps">
    The default branch for git has always been "master", but you should change your configuration so that any new repositories you create will be initialized with a default branch of "main". To do that, run:
    <pre>git config --global init.defaultBranch main<button class="copy-button"></button></pre>
    You can check all your git configurations by running
    <pre>git config --global --list --show-origin<button class="copy-button"></button></pre>
  </div>

  <li id="https-clone"><a href="#https-clone">HTTPS cloning</a></li>
  <div id="https-clone-steps">
    In Dartmouth GitLab, remote access was via SSH. This is still an option with GitHub, but it might be worth considering switching to cloning over HTTPS. The benefits include:
    <ul>
      <li>SSH keys get used in other places and you need to guard them more carefully</li>
      <li>HTTPS is GitHub's default so there is less clicking when using the web UI</li>
    </ul>
    If you're sold, GitHub has some great documenation at <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens">Managing your personal access tokens</a>, but that's a long read. Let me save you some time. Browse to the <a href="https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/install.md">install instructions for Git Credential Manager</a>.
    <p>
      Once the Git Credential Manager is installed, the next time you need to authentication to GitHub via the command line it will intercept the request and prompt you to do an OAuth login in your web browser. This is a one-time event. Alternatively, you can manually initiate the setup by running:
      <pre>git credential-manager github login<button class="copy-button"></button></pre>
      More information is at <a href="https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/usage.md">usage.md</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To review what was setup on GitHub.com:
      <ul>
        <li>Log into GitHub</li>
        <li>Browse to <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications" target="_blank">settings/applications</a> (in the top right click your profile icon and then "Settings", then on the left click "Applications", then finally "Authorized OAuth Apps")</li>
        <li>In the list should be "Git Credential Manager"</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <li id="mulitple-identities"><a href="#mulitple-identities">Multiple identities</a></li>
  <div id="mulitple-identities-steps">
    If you wear mulitple hats and prefer to keep your identities distinct from project to project, read on. Your Git configuration is usually stored in a file at <code>$HOME/.gitconfig</code>. In there you are able to specify how to authenticate to different repositories. For example, the following configuration will load different additional configuration files depending on what path you're in.
    <pre>
[includeIf "gitdir:/Users/bobjones/repos/work/"]
  path = "~/.gitconfig_work"
[includeIf "gitdir:/Users/bobjones/repos/personal/"]
  path = "~/.gitconfig_personal"
</pre>

Then your <code>~/.gitconfig_work</code> could look like
<pre>
[core]
  sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/git-work
</pre>
and <code>~/.gitconfig_personal</code> could look like
<pre>
[credential "https://github.com"]
  username = bobjones
  helper = /usr/local/share/gcm-core/git-credential-manager
</pre>
With this setup in place, your work repos will use a SSH key and your personal repos would use a credential manager for token access.

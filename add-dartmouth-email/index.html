<h1>Add Dartmouth Email</h1>

<p>
  Now that you have a GitHub account, it is time to add your Dartmouth email to it in two forms
  <ul>
  <li>name@dartmouth.edu (might already be there if you created the account for work only)</li>
  <li>netid@dartmouth.edu</li>
</ul>
  Note: that each address is needed and serves different purposes. The name@dartmouth.edu will be linked to your Git commit history and netid@dartmouth.edu ensures Dartmouth Single Sign-On (SSO) works despite name/email changes.
</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Log into GitHub</li>
  <li>Browse to <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails" target="_blank">settings/emails</a> (in the top right click your profile icon and then "Settings", then on the left click "Emails")</li>
  <li>Under the "Add email address" section, add both</li>
    <ul>
    <li>name@dartmouth.edu</li>
    <li>netid@dartmouth.edu</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Go to your mailbox and click the link to complete verification for both addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. You now have a fully setup GitHub account and you're ready to be added as a member of one or more Dartmouth GitHub organizations.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>If you wish to join <a href="https://github.com/dartmouth">https://github.com/dartmouth</a>, please browse to <a href="https://dashboard.dartmouth.edu/github/invitation_request/">https://dashboard.dartmouth.edu/github/invitation_request/</a> and use the "Request Invitation" button.</p>

<p>Access to other Dartmouth's GitHub organizations is limited to invite only. If you were sent these instructions from someone you should also expect them to invite you to the appropriate organizations or give you further instruction.</p>

<h1>Add Dartmouth Email</h1>

<p>
  Now that you have a GitHub account, it is time to add your Dartmouth email to it in two forms
  <ul>
  <li>name@dartmouth.edu (might already be there if you created the account for work only)</li>
  <li>netid@dartmouth.edu (needed for single-sign on to work)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Browse to <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails">https://github.com/settings/emails</a> and log in if required</li>
  <li>Under the "Add email address" section, add both</li>
    <ul>
    <li>name@dartmouth.edu</li>
    <li>netid@dartmouth.edu</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Go to your mailbox and click the link to complete verification for both addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it, you now have a fully setup GitHub account and you're ready to be added as a member of one or more Dartmouth GitHub organizations.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>At this time, access to Dartmouth's GitHub organizations is limited to invite only. In the future, we may open to the broader community. If you were sent these instructions from from a Dartmouth staff member you should also expect them to invite you to the appropriate organizations or give you further instruction.</p>

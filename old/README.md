# Get Started on Dartmouth GitHub

Looking to get started on Dartmouth College's Enterprise GitHub environment? You've come to the right place.

There are three things you need
1. A personal github.com account
2. Your college email address (form: netid@dartmouth.edu) added to it
3. An invite to one or more of the Dartmouth's GitHub organizations within our Enterprise tenant.

Let's get started.
- [I need to create a github.com account](create-account.md)
- [I already have a github.com account](add-dartmouth-email.md)

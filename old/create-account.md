# Create a GitHub account for use with Dartmouth

Here are common scenarios
1. I don't have a GitHub account and only need this for Dartmouth work
2. I have a GitHub account for personal use, but I don't want to use that for my Dartmouth work.

If you fall into (1), follow the steps below and sign up with your college email addresses, both:
- name@dartmouth.edu
- netid@dartmouth.edu

If you fall into (2), you can also follow the steps below, but you can consider alternatively using your personal account. GitHub actually recommends this approach citing that person <-> account is a one-to-one mapping ([reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#:~:text=people%20will%20use-,one%20personal%20account,-for%20all%20their)). For what it's worth, GitHub does a great job at letting you use one account and put on different personas depending on what you're doing.

## Steps

- Browse to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
- In the top-right, click "Sign up"
- Enter your email (e.g. name@dartmouth.edu or handle@gmail.com)
- Enter a strong unique password (definitely different than your Dartmouth password)
- Enter a username (e.g. first-mi-last and anything of your choosing)
- Optionally opt-in to email from GitHub if you want
- Click "Continue"
- You will like now need to complete a challenge to confirm you are human
- After that, you will need to fill in a one-time code that is emailed to you
- Lastly, there are some questions about your team size and role, but you can also click "Skip personalization" at the bottom

## Next steps

Congraduations, you have a GitHub account! The next step is to [add your dartmouth email address](add-dartmouth-email.md) in two forms.

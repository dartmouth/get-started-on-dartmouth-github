<h1>Create a GitHub account for use at Dartmouth</h1>

<p>
  Common scenarios
  <ol>
  <li>I don't have a GitHub account and only need this for Dartmouth work</li>
  <li>I have a GitHub account for personal use, but I don't want to use that for my Dartmouth work</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
  If you fall into (1), follow the steps below and sign up with your college email addresses (name@dartmouth.edu).
</p>

<p>In the case of (2), you can also follow the steps below, but you can consider alternatively using your personal email. GitHub actually recommends this approach citing that a human-to-account is a one-to-one mapping (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#:~:text=people%20will%20use-,one%20personal%20account,-for%20all%20their">reference</a>). For what it's worth, GitHub does a great job at letting you use one account and put on different personas depending on what you're doing. Also, when you leave the college it is easy/automatic to detach from your Dartmouth roles.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Browse to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></li>
<li>In the top-right, click "Sign up"</li>
<li>Enter your email (e.g. name@dartmouth.edu or handle@example.com)</li>
<li>Enter a strong unique password (definitely different than your Dartmouth password)</li>
<li>Enter a username (e.g. first-mi-last and anything of your choosing)</li>
<li>Optionally opt-in to email from GitHub</li>
<li>Click "Continue"</li>
<li>You will likely now need to complete a challenge to confirm you are human</li>
<li>After that, you will need to fill in a one-time code that is emailed to you</li>
<li>Lastly, there are some questions about your team size and role, but you can also click "Skip personalization" at the bottom</li>
</ol>
Congratuations, you have a GitHub account!
